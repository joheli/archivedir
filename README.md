# archivedir
A DOS batch script to archive a directory into a 7-Zip-compressed file.

# What is it for?
This little script takes a folder, compresses it using 7-Zip, attaches a datestamp, and puts it in a folder of your choosing. Neat, right?

# Prerequisites
Go to [7-Zip.org](https://www.7-zip.org/) to install 7-Zip, if it is not already installed on your computer. Please specify the location of the executable in the script under ```Location of 7zip```.

# Usage
Type ```archivedir.bat [Source Folder] [Target Folder]``` to take contents of ```[Source Folder]```, compress them, and put the compressed file into ```[Target folder]```.
